## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains my submission for the **Kasparro.AI Agentic FB Analyst Assignment**.  
The project demonstrates an **end-to-end LLM-first, modular, and agent-driven pipeline** for analyzing Meta Ads performance, deriving insights, evaluating hypotheses, and generating creative recommendations.

The system uses a set of autonomous agents that collaborate to:
- Load and analyze a synthetic Meta ads dataset  
- Generate data-driven insights (ROAS drop, CTR changes, creative fatigue)  
- Validate hypotheses using secondary metrics  
- Suggest better ad copies using past creatives  
- Produce structured output files & execution logs

This repo follows the structure and naming convention exactly as required by Kasparro:
